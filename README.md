# BigTreeTech Octopus-Pro

## Octopus-Pro-V1.1
***V1.1 is to solve the problem of Hotend port being continuously enabled in the STM32H723 version dfu mode***

## Warning for Octopus Pro
* The voltage of all 8 drives can be selected by the jumper, If the jumper is inserted on the left, the corresponding driver voltage is `MOTOR_POWER`, it is `Main Power` if it is inserted on the right. The `MOTOR_POWER` port maximum voltage supported is up to 60V, the `Main Power` port maximum voltage supported is only 28V. The all 8 drivers of this motherboard can be used in any combination `MOTOR_POWER` or `Main Power`.<br/>
***Warning: please make sure that the correct voltage is selected by the jumper In order to use the non high voltage version of the driver (such as: TMC2209, TMC2130, or Non high voltage version TMC5160), otherwise the driver will be burned, and even the motherboard may be burned.***<br/>

## Difference between Octopus-Pro and Octopus V1.0 / V1.1
  1. Support up to 60V high-voltage stepper drivers, and each driver can select the voltage from `MOTOR_POWER` or `Main Power` by jumper.
  2. Both `NPN` and `PNP` type proximity switch are supported on `Probe` port(V1.0 / V1.1 can only supported `PNP` type). ***The IO of this port is no longer multiplexed with Bltouch, and a separate IO `PC5` is used for this port***
  3. On board `INA826` is modified to `Max31865`, which supports PT100 / PT1000 and has higher accuracy.
  4. The pin arrangement of raspberry pi header is modified to be exactly the same as raspberry pi. From top to bottom: `5V 5V GND RX TX`.

## Firmware
  * The bootloaders of all octopus and octopus pro boards are the same for any given MCU variant. You can find them here with instructions: https://github.com/bigtreetech/BIGTREETECH-OCTOPUS-V1.0/tree/master/Firmware/DFU%20Update%20bootloader/bootloader
  * The IO of Octopus-Pro V1.0 and Octopus (non-pro) V1.0 / V1.1 are the same, except the IO of proximity switch `Probe` port is no longer multiplexed with Bltouch and is modified to a separate IO `PC5`. Please refer to [Octopus V1.0/V1.1 here](https://github.com/bigtreetech/BIGTREETECH-OCTOPUS-V1.0)
  * The IO of the Octopus-Pro V1.1 is different with the differences being shown in the table above.
